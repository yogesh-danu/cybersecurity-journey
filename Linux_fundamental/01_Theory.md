This contains theory part of linux i.e. History of Linux , Structure of Linux, distribution of Linux , and Types of Distribution.
## History of **LINUX**
- Before Linux , In 1969 Ken Thompson & Dannis ritchie created UNIX OS in Bell labs.

## Structure of Linux
Linux is a kernel not entire Operating System. The operating system that uses Linux System are called **Linux Distribution** or "**Distros**".
- A Linux system is devided into 3 different parts :-
1. Hardware :- Thisb include all physical part of a computer. Such as CPU,RAM ect.
2. Linux kernel:- Its the core of a OS.it manages hardware and facilitates communication between software and hardware.
3. User Space : This is the environmrnt where user interact with system through aoolications and command-line interfaces.
## Type of Distribution 
### 1. Debian :- 
Debian is an Operating system entirely composed of free and open-source software.it uses apt (Advanced Package Tool) as a package manager.it uses 3 different release channels.
1. Stable :This is official release .it is most secure and reliable version.
2. Testing : This Branch contains packages that are being prepared for next Stable release.
3. Unstable : also known as 'Sid' , this is where actual developments happens.
### 2. Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- also called RHEL,is a commercial Linux distribution developed by Red Hat  for the corporate market.
- RHEL use RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) format for its software package.Its provides high-level tools like YUM(Yellowdog updater,Modified) and ots successor ,DNF(Danified YUM).
- Its predictable release cycle, long term support(up to 10 years or more) , and a vast eco system of certified hardware and software give it an advantage in enterprises.

- it uses the **apt**(Advanced Package Tool) to handle software update ,installation and removal.
- It has its own desktop environment named Unity.
- The new versions have GNOME as default desktop env.
### 4. Fedora
- its based on RHEL,sponsored by RedHat and Communnity driven.
- its Ubuntu of Red Hat Foundation.

- its based on ubuntu and uses its LTS release as its foundation.
- its uses APT as it package maanager.
### 6. Gentoo
- It gives maximum control and flexibility over OS.
