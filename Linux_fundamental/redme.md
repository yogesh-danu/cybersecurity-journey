# Linux Fundamental
This repository documents my journey of learning and practicing **Linux**, with a focus on skills required for cybersecurity. It includes my notes, lab exercises, commands, cheat sheets, and Bash scripting practice.
## Objective
- Build strong Linux fundamentals  
- Practice real-world Linux commands and administration  
- Learn and write Bash scripts  
- Apply Linux skills in cybersecurity labs

## My SETUP FOR PRACTICING IT.
I am using **Windows 11 – WSL2 (Kali Linux)** for hands-on practice.  
WSL2 Kali is fast, lightweight, and perfect for learning Linux basics before moving to full VMs like VirtualBox or VMware.
